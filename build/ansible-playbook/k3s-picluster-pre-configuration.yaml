# k3s-picluster-pre-configuration.yaml
---
# This playbook performs initial system configuration on all nodes in the PiKube Kubernetes cluster leveraging k3s.
# It ensures that the necessary kernel modules are loaded and sysctl settings are applied
# to support Kubernetes networking requirements. Additionally, it configures cgroup settings
# on Raspberry Pi nodes to meet Kubernetes runtime requirements.
