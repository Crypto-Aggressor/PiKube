# dnsmasq-logrotate.conf
# This configuration file sets the rules for rotating dnsmasq logs.
# Log rotation ensures that the log files don't grow indefinitely, potentially consuming all available disk space.
# This setup rotates logs specifically associated with dnsmasq activity.

# The log file for dnsmasq is typically stored in /var/log/syslog.
# However, dnsmasq logs might be stored elsewhere depending on your specific configuration or operating system.
# Make sure to adjust the path if your dnsmasq logs are located in a different file.
/var/log/syslog {

    # Rotate the log files on a daily basis.
    daily
    
    # Keep logs for the last 7 days. After this period, older logs will be removed.
    # Adjust this value if you want to retain logs for a longer or shorter period.
    rotate 7

    # Compress the rotated logs using gzip to save space.
    # This converts, for example, dnsmasq.log.1 into dnsmasq.log.1.gz.
    compress

    # Delay compression to the next rotation cycle. This can help avoid issues
    # with compressing logs that are still being written to.
    delaycompress
    
    # Append a date extension (like YYYYMMDD) to the rotated logs for clarity.
    # This makes it easier to identify the exact date of a specific log file.
    dateext

    # If the log file does not exist, don't generate an error or attempt to rotate it.
    # This prevents unnecessary error messages if dnsmasq is not logging to the specified file.
    missingok

    # If the log file is empty (no entries), skip rotation for that day.
    notifempty

    # After rotation, create a new empty log file with specified permissions.
    # In this case, the owner is 'root', the group is 'adm', and it has 0640 permissions.
    create 0640 root adm

    # Uncomment the section below if you need to restart a service after log rotation.
    # This can be useful if a service needs to recognize the newly created log file.
    # In most cases, dnsmasq does not require a restart after log rotation.
    # 
    # postrotate
    #     /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart > /dev/null
    # endscript
