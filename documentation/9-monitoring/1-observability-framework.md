## Observability Framework

This document outlines an integrated observability and monitoring framework specifically designed for PiKube Kubernetes Service:

TODO pikube-observability-architecture.drawio

The framework facilitates comprehensive monitoring of application **`traces`**, **`logs`**, and **`metrics`**, offering a unified dashboard that consolidates all application data for easy **`visualization`** and **`analysis`**.

The observability framework incorporates the following key components:

- [**`Loki`**](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) for logging
- [**`Grafana Tempo`**](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) for distributed tracing
- [**`Prometheus`**](https://prometheus.io/) for monitoring
- [**`Grafana`**](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) as the unified interface

Additionally, the framework includes a log analytics component built on [**`Elasticsearch`**](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) and [**`Kibana`**](https://www.elastic.co/fr/kibana), enhancing its logging capabilities.

A unified log collection and distribution layer, implemented using Fluent Bit/Fluentd, channels logs to both the **`Log Analytics platform, Elasticsearch`** and the **`Log Monitoring platform, Loki`**.
