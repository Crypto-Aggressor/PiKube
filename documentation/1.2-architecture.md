### Gateway Node

**1 Gateway Node:**

- Name: gateway (Raspberry Pi 4B, 4GB)
- Role: Acts as the cluster's primary router and firewall.

### Master Nodes

**3 Master Nodes:**

- blueberry-master (Raspberry Pi 4B, 4GB)
- strawberry-master (Raspberry Pi 4B, 8GB)
- blackberry-master (Raspberry Pi 4B, 8GB)

### Worker Nodes

**4 Worker Nodes:**

- cranberry-worker  (Raspberry Pi 5, 8GB)
- raspberry-worker  (Raspberry Pi 3B+, 1GB)
- orange-worker     (Orange Pi 5B, 16GB)
- mandarine-worker  (Orange Pi 5B, 16GB)

### Networking Hardware

The network's backbone is an 8-port Gigabit LAN switch, providing Layer 2 connectivity. The **`gateway`**, connects the cluster to the Internet, serving as a router and firewall. It connects to the LAN switch and to the home network via WiFi, creating a secure network environment for the cluster.

### Networking Services

The **`gateway`** node offers essential networking services:

- [Router/Firewall](https://github.com/Crypto-Aggressor/PiKube-Kubernetes-Cluster/blob/production/documentation/0-definitions.md#router-firewall): Controls internet access and network security.
- [DNS](https://github.com/Crypto-Aggressor/PiKube-Kubernetes-Cluster/blob/production/documentation/0-definitions.md#dns): Domain Name System services.
- [NTP](https://github.com/Crypto-Aggressor/PiKube-Kubernetes-Cluster/blob/production/documentation/0-definitions.md#ntp): Network Time Protocol for time synchronization.
- [DHCP](https://github.com/Crypto-Aggressor/PiKube-Kubernetes-Cluster/blob/production/documentation/0-definitions.md#dhcp): Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for network management.

For enhanced Kubernetes API availability, an HAProxy load balancer is deployed on the gateway.

### Ansible Control Node

The **`pimaster`**, an Ansible control node, is a Docker Linux VM on a Windows laptop or Windows Subsystem for Linux. It manages the cluster's configuration, connecting to the home network and facilitating communication with cluster nodes.
